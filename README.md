# Air-Quality-Prediction 

## 📌 Overview  
Air pollution is one of the major environmental challenges affecting human health and climate. This project focuses on predicting **Air Quality Index (AQI)** using different machine learning models. By analyzing air pollution datasets with features such as **PM2.5, PM10, NO₂, SO₂, CO, and O₃**, the goal is to build an accurate predictive model to classify/predict the air quality level.
